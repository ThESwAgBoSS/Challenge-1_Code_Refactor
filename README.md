# challenge-1_code_refactor

#Description
 This project was me refracting code to add semantic elements, alt. attributes, and simplifying and cleaning up the code. 
 The purpose of this project is to help those who want a more optimized and beneficial search for their company.
 This solves the problem of removing untrue comments slandering your companies name and helps increase your companies visibility. 
 On this project I learned how padding effects spacing of elements and how it allows me to shift child elents inside of parent elements.

#Usage
 This code has set up a website which can be search. You would simply navigate the webpage and selected which topic you would like to read more about.
