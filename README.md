# challenge-1_code_refactor

#Description
-This project was me refracting code to add semantic elements, alt. attributes, and simplifying and cleaning up the code. 
-The purpose of this project is to help those who want a more optimized and beneficial search for their company.
-This solves the problem of removing untrue comments slandering your companies name and helps increase your companies visibility. 
-On this project I learned how padding effects spacing of elements and how it allows me to shift child elents inside of parent elements.

#Usage
-This code has set up a website which can be search. You would simply navigate the webpage and selected which topic you would like to read more about.
